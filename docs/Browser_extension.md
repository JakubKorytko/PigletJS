![Browser extension in action](extension.gif)

PigletJS provides a browser extension that enhances the development experience by allowing you to inspect and interact with your PigletJS applications directly from the browser.
Currently, the extension is available in [extension directory](https://github.com/JakubKorytko/PigletJS/tree/master/extension) or can be selected when building the project with setup script.
You can install it as an unpacked extension in your browser for development purposes, but it is also planned to be available on the Chrome Web Store in the future.
